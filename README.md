# Pentesting Live Targets
Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. 

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description: In the salesperson page with the URL ending with "?id=XX", when tested by adding an single apostrophe to the end of the url, the red and green page simply redirect, while the blue page shows a SQL error message saying "Database query failed."

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description:When a user of the public site provides feedback, they can create an XSS alert that once the admin (or being logged on with username pperson)
can show each individual alert as a pop-up. This can be a huge issue as the pop-up alerts are not only annoying to whoever is checking the feedback, but the pop-ups could potentially redirect the logged in user to another site with malicious intent.

Vulnerability #2: 

Description: 
## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: The salesperson database can be accessed by changing the "?id=" tag in the url, and this can be used to access salespersons of id 10 and 11, while the publicly displayed data ends at id=9. The other sites when one enters 10 or 11 in the same place they redirect to the 'Find Salesperson' page which is more secure especially as one may not want all employees(past or present) to be visible to the public.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
- Attempting to find the SQL injection was very difficult because I thought that it was only possible through the site's various forms so when experimenting with the URL it was certainly satisfying
- Finding the IDOR was a big challenge as well as I was inspecting the elements within various pages to see if there was coding differences amongst the other sites.
- Hello GenCyber students, here is your flag: GC24{OSINT_IS_FUN}
